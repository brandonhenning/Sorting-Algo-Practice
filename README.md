# Sorting Algo Practice

## What This Is
I realized I needed more practice on understanding sorting algorithms and decided to get some practice writing them in Node.js. They are pretty basic but it was fun to write them out and understand the difference in compute time and reasons for using each sorting algo. 

## Algorithms Completed 
- [Bubble Sort](bubble-sort.js)
- [Insertion Sort](insertion.js)
